CRYPTO CLUSTERING


This challenge, uses Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. 

Note: Kmeans is consistant throughout the project

Normally, it is incouraged to try different cluster numbers to find the best value for k, but the best k value was evident in the first 
elbow curve. I felt it prudent to maintain the originally determined value to show a true contrast between the original scaled data and optimized data.
Using optimazation enabled more refined results.
